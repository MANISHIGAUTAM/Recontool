**Purpose.** Twitter account analytics. Better for marketing than OSINT.

## Invocation

```text
# API integration (fill endpoint/auth in config/tools.yaml -> social-bearing)
GET https://<provider-endpoint>/...   # key: see config/recontool.yaml
```
> Invocation template is a placeholder — wire the exact endpoint/flags in `config/tools.yaml` and implement an adapter under `recontool/adapters/`.

## Inputs / outputs

- **Consumes:** `username / handle / org` (per pipeline position).
- **Produces:** normalized records (subdomains / ips / urls / services / findings as applicable) → mapped to the common schema in [`docs/D3-data-schema.md`](../D3-data-schema.md).
- **Output format (raw):** JSON/JSONL/text per tool; raw stored under `artifacts/<scan_id>/raw/`.

## Operational behavior

- **Confidence / false-positive risk:** worth=`Medium` (score 0.6). Higher-tier source — still corroborated via multi-source confidence scoring.
- **If it rate-limits / errors:** exponential backoff + retry; rotate API key from pool; on repeated 401/403 disable for the run and audit.
- **If it returns nothing:** record an empty result with provenance (not a failure); continue the pipeline.
- **Scope safety:** active tools re-check scope before egress; out-of-scope targets are stored but never probed (see `docs/D6-opsec.md`).
